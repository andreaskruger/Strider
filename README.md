# Strider

This project is heavily inspired by the following project:
https://www.instructables.com/Strider-Camera-Robot/?fbclid=IwAR1EOQxCRcuCgMuUUKUXIHLOcQfZN6SbGhrLjS-cwZcN2zmzy7T6LxK0bEU
I have not created any of the 3d files.

The above mentiond strider is modified by adding sensors and code for following a line(Linefollower). The sensors use either a camera for detecting the line or 
a QTR sensor, the control is a a simple PID.
